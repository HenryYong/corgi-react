## Corgi-React

This is an UI component library based on react. This lib is inspired by [Element React](https://github.com/eleme/element-react) and [MagicBox](https://magicbox.bk.tencent.com/#index?isPro=1). The structure of this project is referred from Element React. We may also treat this lib as an exercise of library construction. Also, the color combination is referred from MagicBox in which is the team I am working.



## Install

```javascript
npm install corgi-react --save
```

There is another module for theme:

```javascript
npm install corgi-theme --save
```



## Usage

```javascript
import { Button } from 'corgi-react'
```

If you are not familiar with this grammar, you really need to learn something named [ECMAScript 2015](https://developer.mozilla.org/zh-CN/docs/Web/JavaScript).
